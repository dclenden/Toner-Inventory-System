# Toner-Inventory-System
This project is based on CSC214's project of creating a working toner inventory system for the IT dept at DTCC. This project was designed
with the DTCC tech in mind. The User Interface has the minimal functionality needed for the inventory system to function without asking
for too much input from the tech themselves. The operations on the backend should not need to be seen by the user in order to understand
the program and how it is intended to be used.

NOTE: various documents are provided in the "Documents" folder, while all the testing CSV's are within the "TestFiles folder".
